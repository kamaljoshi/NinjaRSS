==============================
A flexible platformer in which all the art can be modified and level structure is open for editing and modding.
===================================

You can either compile the code from makefile or open up it in codeblocks. This uses SDL so it can be targeted for Ubuntu/OS X/Windows. 

The required libraries for Windows have been added in the default project structure for it to be able to run. Copy all the DLL files from the DLL folder and keep it together them with your executable. The Content folder contains everything other than game logic, so it should be in the root directory along with the executable for the game to run.

how to run
=============================
If you are being lazy and just want to run this.
1) Move the NinjaRSS executable to a folder with the folder Content(from the main directory).
2) Copy all the DLLs from the DLL folder and bring it to that folder.
3) Run it and enjoy!
